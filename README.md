## 4462 Chess Problems

In 1994, famed chess teacher [László Polgár](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r) published [*Chess*](https://www.amazon.com/Chess-5334-Problems-Combinations-Games/dp/1579129501/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0), a compilation of 4,462 checkmate problems.

In a bid to improve my own game, I plan to work through these problems at a languid pace, updating a simple database file as I go along. This will also likely be of value to other chess enthusiasts.

I'm not sure if this project violates copyright. Since many of these problems were taken by Polgár from other sources and I haven't explicitly copied anything from the book, my guess is no.
