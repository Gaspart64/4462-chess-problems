## Chess Puzzles

In 1994, famed chess teacher [László Polgár](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r) published [*Chess*](https://www.amazon.com/Chess-5334-Problems-Combinations-Games/dp/1579129501/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0), a compilation of 4,462 checkmate problems.

In a bid to improve my own game, I plan to work through these problems at a languid pace, updating a simple database file as I go along. This will also likely be of value to other chess enthusiasts.

Presently, I've just copied [this](http://chessboardjs.com/examples/2006) example from Chris Oakman's wonderful 2013 chessboard.js. This should hopefully evolve into a puzzle recorder that I can use for study.

I'm not sure if this project violates copyright. Since most of these problems were taken by Polgár from existing games, my guess is no.
